This is my cyclefinding visualizer. This program is able to simulate 4 diferent algorithms. These algorithms include greedy search, brute force, two opt swap, and my custom convex hull method.

## How to Use
left click - add point, remove point

space - run the algorithm

c - clear the screen

1 - switch to greedy

2 - switch to brute force

3 - switch to two opt swap

4 - switch to hull
